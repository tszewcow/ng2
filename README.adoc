= OASP4JS Angular 2 Project Seed

This is an Angular 2 Project Seed (aka application template) which supports you while developing, testing and building
your Angular 2 applications for production. This project seed is essentially based on the https://github.com/angular/quickstart[Angular 2 Quick Start]. What
was added to it are http://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] with its plugins to make the project seed more configurable and useful while developing,
testing and building Angular 2 applications.

== Getting Started

=== Install prerequisites

You need a Git client, the https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] platform (including its package manager - https://www.npmjs.com/[npm]) and http://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] to make use of the project seed.
It is highly recommended to use the following versions:

* Node.js 5.12.0
* npm 3.3.6
* Gulp 3.9.1

Please refer to the link:#prerequisites[FAQ section] for details on how to install the prerequisites.

=== Install the OASP4JS Angular 2 Project Seed

Clone the `oasp4js-ng2-project-seed` repository:

....
git clone https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-ng2-project-seed.git
....

Install all node.js dependencies (this may take several minutes when doing for the first time):

....
cd oasp4js-ng2-project-seed
npm install
....

Start a sample Angular 2 application:

....
gulp
....

Your default browser opens and shows the sample Angular 2 application. What is more, you can now develop your application
using your favorite IDE while the Gulp process is watching for your changes and upon them reloads the sample application
automatically in your browser.

== Using the OASP4JS Angular 2 Project Seed

The OASP4JS Angular 2 Project Seed offers developers a few Gulp tasks which support them.

=== Building

....
gulp build
....

Transpiles your TypeScript sources into JavaScript, processes http://lesscss.org/[Less] / http://sass-lang.com/[Sass] files into CSS ones,
copies HTML files, images, fonts, etc. to the temporary directory (which defaults to `.tmp`).

....
gulp build:dist
....

Does all what `gulp build` does and additionally minimizes HTML and CSS files as well as concatenates all JavaScript
files into one file and eventually minimizes and obfuscates it. After executing this task, in the destination directory
(which defaults to `dist`) you can find an application optimized for production.

=== Running

....
gulp serve
....

Executes `gulp build` and starts a https://www.browsersync.io/[Browsersync] web server which serves the web content
from the temporary directory (where the results of `gulp build` are saved). In addition to this, the sources,
such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, image files, are watched for changes. Upon a change, your browser will be reloaded
automatically.

....
gulp serve:dist
....

Executes `gulp build:dist` and starts a https://www.browsersync.io/[Browsersync] web server which serves the web content
from the destination directory (where the results of `gulp build:dist` are saved). No sources are watched for changes.

=== Testing

....
gulp test
....

Starts linting your source code (using https://palantir.github.io/tslint/[TSLint]) and - if no errors found - executes
your tests (specs) using http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html[Karma] against the http://phantomjs.org/[PhantomJS]
headless browser.

....
gulp test:tdd
....

As in `gulp test`, executes your specs using http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html[Karma]
against the http://phantomjs.org/[PhantomJS] browser, but without linting and the Gulp process doesn't end. It watches
for your code changes instead. This mode is recommended for developers applying the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development[Test Driven Development] technique.

....
gulp test:tdd:debug
....

In addition to `gulp test:tdd` allows you to debug your application while testing. Therefore the specs are executed
against the Chrome browser.

....
gulp test:coverage
....

In addition to `gulp test` code coverage reports (`HTML`, `Cobertura` and `lcov`) are generated in the `test-output` directory.

=== Miscellaneous

....
gulp lint
....

Lints your source code (using https://palantir.github.io/tslint/[TSLint]).

....
gulp clean
....

=== Environment specific behaviour

In the `app\_env` directory you can find TypeScript files, `environment.dev.ts` and `environment.prod.ts` which add
environment specific (e.g. development, production) behavior to your application. These files can be modified as needed.
During the build, depending on the target platform, one of these files is renamed to `environment.ts` and transpiled to JavaScript.

You can import the current environment file somewhere in your TypeScript sources; this is an example from the https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-ng2-project-seed/blob/master/app/main.ts[main.ts]:

[source,javascript]
----
import {enableProdMode} from '@angular/core';
import {environment} from './_env/environment';

if (environment.enableProdMode) {
  enableProdMode();
}

== Frequently Asked Questions

=== [[prerequisites]]How to install the prerequisites?

==== Git
Check if you have a Git client already installed:

----
git --version
----

If your OS can not recognize this command, install Git. For details please refer to http://git-scm.com[this page].
When installing under Windows, please make sure you check the following option:

- [*] Use git from Windows command prompt

==== Node.js

It is highly recommended to install the  https://github.com/creationix/nvm[Node Version Manager] which manages multiple active
Node.js versions on your machine. The windows version of nvm can be found https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades[here].

==== Gulp

http://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] is a streaming build system. Install the Gulp globally using the npm. Type the following command in the command line tool:

----
npm install -g gulp
----

In order to check if Gulp was correctly installed you can check its version by typing:

----
gulp --version
----

=== How to add a new JavaScript library?

As is the case in the https://github.com/angular/quickstart[Angular 2 Quick Start], this project seed uses
npm for dependency management and https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs[SystemJS] for module loading.

Let us assume you would like to add a very popular JavaScript utility library - https://lodash.com/[lodash]. First
install it using npm:

----
npm install lodash --save
----

The above command downloads the library to your `node_modules` directory and updates the `package.json` file.

Second, let SystemJS know that the library can be imported in your TypeScript files; add this to the `systemjs.config.json` file:

[source,javascript]
----
map: {
  ...
  'lodash': 'npm:lodash'
}
packages: {
  ...
  'lodash': {
    main: './index.js',
    defaultExtension: 'js'
  }
}
----

Third, import the library in your TypeScript class and use it:

[source,javascript]
----
import * as _ from 'lodash';

export class MyClass {
  myMethod(): void {
    ...
    _.cloneDeep({name: 'John'});
  }
}
----

=== How to replace Bootstrap with Angular Material?

Switch to the `angular-material` branch:

----
git checkout angular-material
----

install npm dependencies:

----
npm install
----

and run the project seed:

----
gulp
----

=== Start with json server

Install json-server

----
npm install -g json-server
----

Start json-server from the project root directory

----
json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json --port 4050
